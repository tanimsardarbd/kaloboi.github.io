						<h1>Hover Slide Effect</h1>
						<p>Today we will create a neat effect with some images using
							jQuery. The main idea is to have an image area with several
							images that slide out when we hover over them, revealing
							other images. The sliding effect will be random, i.e.
							the images will slide to the top or bottom, left or
							right, fading out or not. When we click on any area,
							all areas will slide their images out.</p>

						<h1>Merging Image Boxes</h1>
						<p>Today we will show you a nice effect for images with jQuery.
							The idea is to have a set of rotated thumbnails that,
							once clicked, animate to form the selected image.
							You can navigate through the images with previous
							and next buttons and when the big image gets clicked
							it will scatter into the little box shaped thumbnails again.</p>

						<h1>Compact News Previewer</h1>
						<p>Today we will create a news previewer that let‚Äôs you
							show your latest articles or news in a compact way.
							The news previewer will show some list of articles
							on the left side and the preview of the article with a
							longer description on the right. Once a news on the left
							is clicked, the preview will slide in.</p>

						<h1>Overlay Effect Menu</h1>
						<p>In this tutorial we are going to create a simple menu
							that will stand out once we hover over it by covering
							everything except the menu with a dark overlay.
							The menu will stay white and a submenu area will
							expand. We will create this effect using jQuery.</p>

						<h1>Polaroid Photobar Gallery</h1>
						<p>In this tutorial we are going to create an image gallery
							with a Polaroid look. We will have albums that will expand
							to sets of slightly rotated thumbnails that pop out on hover.
							The full image will slide in from the bottom once a thumbnail
							is clicked. In the full image view the user can navigate
							through the pictures or simply choose another thumbnail
							to be displayed.</p>

						<h1>Pull Out Content Panel</h1>
						<p>In this tutorial we will create a content panel that 
							slides out at a predefined scroll position. It will 
							reveal a teaser with related content and it can be 
							expanded to full page size to show more. A custom 
							slider allows to scroll through many items in the 
							panel.</p>

						<p>In this tutorial we are going to create an extraordinary
